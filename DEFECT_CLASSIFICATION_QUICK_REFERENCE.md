# Quick Reference: Common Defect Classifications

## Most Common Blade Defects

### Leading Edge Erosion
```
Category: Blade
Material: Surface
Defect Type: Erosion
Subtype: Chip
```
**When to use:** Damage to the leading edge surface, typically from rain, hail, or debris impact.

### Top Coat Cracks
```
Category: Blade
Material: Top Coat
Defect Type: Crack
Subtype: Fatigue Cracks | T-LC Shaped | Spider Web Shaped
```
**When to use:** Surface cracks in the protective coating, often from UV exposure or mechanical stress.

### Laminate Delamination
```
Category: Blade
Material: Laminate
Defect Type: Delamination
Subtype: Lightning | None
```
**When to use:** Separation of composite layers, may be caused by lightning strikes or manufacturing defects.

### Structure Cracks
```
Category: Blade
Material: Structure
Defect Type: Crack
Subtype: Transverse | Longitudinal | T-LC Shaped | Diagonal | Trailing Transverse
```
**When to use:** Deep cracks affecting structural integrity, requires immediate attention.

### Through-Thickness Bondline Defects
```
Category: Blade
Material: Through
Defect Type: Bondline
Subtype: Crushed | Open Tip | None
```
**When to use:** Defects that penetrate through the entire blade thickness, often at bondlines.

## Most Common Auxiliary Component Defects

### Damaged Vortex Generators
```
Category: Auxiliary Component
Component: Vortex Generators
Defect Type: Damaged Or Misaligned
```
**When to use:** VGs are bent, broken, or not properly aligned.

### Missing Lightning Receptors
```
Category: Auxiliary Component
Component: Lightning Receptors
Defect Type: Missing
```
**When to use:** Lightning receptor is completely absent or fallen off.

### Damaged Leading Edge Protection
```
Category: Auxiliary Component
Component: Leading Edge Protection
Defect Type: Damaged
```
**When to use:** Leading edge protection tape is torn, peeling, or damaged.

### Damaged Serrations
```
Category: Auxiliary Component
Component: Serrations
Defect Type: Damaged Or Misaligned | Missing
```
**When to use:** Trailing edge serrations (noise reducers) are damaged or missing.

## Quick Decision Tree

### Step 1: Is it on the blade itself or an attached component?
- **Blade surface/material** ? Select "Blade"
- **Attached part** ? Select "Auxiliary Component"

### Step 2: If Blade - What layer is affected?
- **Surface only (paint, coating surface)** ? Surface
- **Protective coating layer** ? Top Coat
- **Composite layers** ? Laminate
- **Structural components (spar, webs)** ? Structure
- **Goes all the way through** ? Through

### Step 3: What type of damage?
Choose from the available options based on your previous selections.

### Step 4: Is there a specific subtype?
If applicable, select the most accurate subtype.

## Severity Guidelines

- **1 (Cosmetic):** Surface discoloration, minor paint chips
- **2 (Minor):** Small cracks in top coat, minor erosion
- **3 (Medium):** Moderate erosion, delamination beginning
- **4 (Serious):** Structural cracks, significant delamination
- **5 (Very Serious):** Through-thickness damage, critical structural issues

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

? **Don't classify surface erosion as Structure**
- Surface erosion affects only the outer layer
- Use: Blade > Surface > Erosion

? **Don't classify VG damage as Blade defect**
- VGs are auxiliary components
- Use: Auxiliary Component > Vortex Generators > Damaged Or Misaligned

? **Don't skip subtypes when they're important**
- Fatigue cracks vs. lightning cracks need different responses
- Always select the most specific classification

? **Don't confuse Top Coat with Surface**
- Surface = outer paint/coating surface
- Top Coat = the gel coat/protective layer beneath

## Field Tips

1. **Take clear photos** before classifying
2. **Zoom in** to determine the depth of damage
3. **Check multiple angles** when unsure about classification
4. **Document uncertainty** in notes/recommendations
5. **When in doubt**, choose the less severe classification and add a note

## Regional Variations

Some turbine manufacturers use different terminology:
- **Gel Coat** = Top Coat in our system
- **Skin** = Surface in our system
- **Bond Line** = Bondline (Through material)
- **Spar** = Structure

Always map manufacturer terminology to our standardized classification.

**Remember:** The classification system is hierarchical - each level narrows down the exact type of defect. Start broad (Category) and get more specific (Subtype).
